# cpp-compile-time-register-machine

A C++17 compile time register machine based off the Scheme (LISP) register machine grammar,
as discussed in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP).

This module is self-contained, in the sense that it does not use the standard namespace (*std::*).
