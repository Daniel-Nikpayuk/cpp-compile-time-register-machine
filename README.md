# cpp-compile-time-register-machine

**As of Monday June 28th 2021 this repo is now defunct: If you want the most recent version
of what is otherwise the same code, it has been integrated into my
[nik cpp library](https://github.com/Daniel-Nikpayuk/nik-cpp-library) repo.**

With that said, if you are otherwise interested in the slides to my
[C++Now 2021 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLFz7rWRlyk) I have archived them here
for your convenience.

Thank you.
